System Information Batch File for Troubleshooting

Rawgit is used because GitHub sets all raw downloads as type text, so web browsers will always open the file in a new browser tab, and Safari will always append .txt to the downloaded file. Rawgit is a service that sets the mime type correctly, so the file is downloaded as a .bat file.

Once Answerhub supports setting the mime type in the URL, using Rawgit will no longer be necessary.
